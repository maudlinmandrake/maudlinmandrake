#  ✨ HI, I'M JENNY ✨

I'm a student developer currently working through Angela Yu's [web dev bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and the freeCodeCamp [responsive web design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). My first forays into the web dev world involved making some really embarassing newsletters via AOL Zine World and customizing my Neopets page when I was just a wee one of 10, and somewhere along the way I kinda forgot how much I loved doing this stuff. Now that my daughter is only a year away from kindergarten, I'm hoping to get a job as a junior web developer. When not up to my elbows in CSS or Play-Doh, I'm tending to my [digital garden](https://maudlinmandrake.github.io/digital-garden/), reading, or participating in the [#100DaysofCode challenge](https://github.com/maudlinmandrake/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).
