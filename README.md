I'm a student developer currently working through freeCodeCamp's free curriculum. Previously, I logged well over 100 hours through Angela Yu's [web dev bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). My first forays into the web dev world involved making some really embarassing newsletters via AOL Zine World and customizing my Neopets page when I was just a wee one of 10, and somewhere along the way I kinda forgot how much I loved doing this stuff. Now that my daughter is only a year away from kindergarten, I'm hoping to get a job as a junior web developer. When not up to my elbows in CSS or Play-Doh, I'm tending to my [internet homestead](https://jennymikac.dev), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63139573-jenny-mikac), and taking care of my [houseplants](https://www.notion.so/codexvitae/Houseplants-3b1370377d9845dc8166373f166224b3).

## MOST RECENT PROJECTS
[Documentation Page](https://maudlinmandrake.github.io/documentation-page/) - HTML documentation page created as a part of my freeCodeCamp curriculum. The goal was to create an acccesible and responsive page that is easily navigated with a keyboard while being usable and pleasing to the eye on both desktop and mobile devices.
